<h2>Selecting a Gun</h2>
<p>There are quite a lot of guns to choose from, with each having their own pros and cons in different combat scenarios. While some may tell you otherwise, there is no one gun that can solve every situation you come across!</p>

<p><b>Pistols</b> are compact, generally cheap, easy to handle, and accurate. They're a perfect weapon to get into for those looking to get into ranged self defence, as they can be used by people by all skill levels. You don't need two hands to operate a pistol, and if you're a skilled user, you can even use two pistols at once for double the firepower!</p>

<p><b>Revolvers</b>, like pistols, are generally cheap, and easy to handle, but generally high amounts of damage compared to regular pistols at the cost of a reduced firerate and reduced magazine size. They're for the more skilled and careful shooter.</p>

<p><b>SMGs</b> are relatively compact, fast firing, and excellent for medium range combat. They typically use calibres used by pistols, but they fire significantly faster and have greater magazine sizes. An SMG is an excellent choice if you're willing to spend more on ammo for more firepower.</p>

<p><b>Shotguns</b> are bulky, slow firing, but have extremely high stopping power at close range. Shotguns generally require two hands to hold, and generally more difficult to reload as most shotguns are not magazine fed. Shotguns have a lot of speciality ammo to make them extremely versatile to an expert.<p>
