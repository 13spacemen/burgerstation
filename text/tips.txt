When hitting a target, the body part you hit is affected by your targeting indicator at the bottom right of the screen. Whether or not your shot lands as intended is determined by your precision skill.
You will always hit the targeted limb when targeting an NPC who isn't aware of your presence.
Grabbing an enemy and hitting them with a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, or your fists will always deal critical damage.
Delivering objects to cargo, regardless if they are part of your objectives, will grant a bonus payment relative to the value of the object. All items have some value to NanoTrasen, including corpses.
Objects abandoned for a long time, on station or the battlefield, will likely be stolen or cleaned up after a while.
Bicaridine heals brute damage. Kelotane heals burn damage. Dylovene heals toxin damage.
You can butcher most animals or creatures for meat and materials if you have a sharp enough melee weapon for it.
Shotguns, SMGs, and Carbines are good for taking on groups of enemies.
Rifles are good for picking out targets from a long range. They require more skill to use effectively, however.
Critical hits can occur randomly when attacking enemies. Most weapons give a guaranteed critical hit when attacking enemies not in combat. Some weapons even have special critical hit conditions.
Worn and held equipment can slow you down based on the weight of the object and how cumbersome it is to move with it.
NPCs also have their own ammo count to manage. A valid tactic to counter an onslaught of NPCs is to wait it out until they run out of ammo.
NanoTrasen typically uses NATO designated cartridges such as 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and 9mm rounds, while the syndicate primarily use calibre designated cartridges such as .223, .308, and .357. Some exceptions are made for weapons designed to infiltrate as they are better suited to fit enemy cartridges they would obtain on the field.
.38 special rounds are actually just shorter .357 rounds, and can fit into .357 chambered weapons.
Sneaking is a viable way to get around enemies you don't want to engage. To sneak, press the sneak key (Default: C) or press the sneak button at the bottom right of your screen. Note that sneaking drains stamina when moving, and should be used sparingly.
You're twice as effective at sneaking when laying down (resting).
Sneaking does nothing to enemies already engaged in combat, regardless if they are your target.
Grabbing an enemy from behind will stun and disarm them them for 3 seconds.
You can only grab team members who are on the ground.
Disarms have a chance to shove people, staggering them. If a staggered enemy hits an object behind them, they're stunned for the duration of the stagger.
